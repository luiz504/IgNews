"Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the blog project I created during a ReactJS
boot camp. This project was built using Next.js, Stripe, OAuth with NextAuth with
the GitHub provider, FaunaDB, Prismic, and Jest.

The main purpose of this project was to enhance my knowledge and skills in unit
testing. As part of the boot camp, we were taught to use Sass, but I
took the initiative to switch to Tailwind CSS to further develop my skills in
that area.

The project is based on an old module from the Ignite boot camp in 2021. It served
as a valuable case study to learn and practice unit testing with Jest.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback. I'm open to collaboration and
appreciate any suggestions for improvement.

Thank you for visiting and happy coding! âœ¨"
